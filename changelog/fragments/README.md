# Changelog Fragments

Use this directory when a PR should not edit `CHANGELOG.md` directly.

- One fragment file per PR.
- File name recommendation: `pr-<number>.md`.
- Include at least one line with both `#<pr>` and `thanks @<contributor>`.

Example:

```md
- Fix LINE monitor lifecycle wait ownership (#27001) (thanks @alice)
```
