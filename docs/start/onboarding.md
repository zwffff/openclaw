# Onboarding (macOS App)

This doc describes the **current** first‑run onboarding flow. The goal is a
smooth “day 0” experience: pick where the Gateway runs, connect auth, run the
wizard, and let the agent bootstrap itself.
For a general overview of onboarding paths, see [Onboarding Overview](/start/onboarding-overview).

Security trust model:

- By default, OpenClaw is a personal agent: one trusted operator boundary.
- Shared/multi-user setups require lock-down (split trust boundaries, keep tool access minimal, and follow [Security](/gateway/security)).

Where does the **Gateway** run?

- **This Mac (Local only):** onboarding can configure auth and write credentials
  locally.
- **Remote (over SSH/Tailnet):** onboarding does **not** configure local auth;
  credentials must exist on the gateway host.
- **Configure later:** skip setup and leave the app unconfigured.

<Tip>
**Gateway auth tip:**

- The wizard now generates a **token** even for loopback, so local WS clients must authenticate.
- If you disable auth, any local process can connect; use that only on fully trusted machines.
- Use a **token** for multi‑machine access or non‑loopback binds.

</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Permissions">
<Frame caption="Choose what permissions do you want to give OpenClaw">
<img src="/assets/macos-onboarding/05-permissions.png" alt="" />
</Frame>

Onboarding requests TCC permissions needed for:

- Automation (AppleScript)
- Notifications
- Accessibility
- Screen Recording
- Microphone
- Speech Recognition
- Camera
- Location

</Step>
<Step title="CLI">
  <Info>This step is optional</Info>
  The app can install the global `openclaw` CLI via npm/pnpm so terminal
  workflows and launchd tasks work out of the box.
</Step>
<Step title="Onboarding Chat (dedicated session)">
  After setup, the app opens a dedicated onboarding chat session so the agent can
  introduce itself and guide next steps. This keeps first‑run guidance separate
  from your normal conversation. See [Bootstrapping](/start/bootstrapping) for
  what happens on the gateway host during the first agent run.
